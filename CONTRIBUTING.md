Find something to do
====================
You can find work on the GitHub issue tracker: https://github.com/AXR/Framework/issues.

If there is an unassigned or old task, post a comment asking for assignment.
Make sure you follow the coding standards and our workflow, which you can find
below.

The workflow
============
If you are not used to Git, go ahead and read more here: http://help.github.com/

Also relevant to our workflow:

 * http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/
 * http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/

1. Go ahead and fork the AXR/Framework repo. You will use that repository as
your working repo.
2. You can make any changes you like to it.
3. When you finish, go to your fork and send a pull request. We'll review it as
soon as possible. After it has been reviewed and accepted, we will merge it into
the official repository.
