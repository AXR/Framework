The AXR Project
===============
The AXR Project is a revolutionary open source project that will fundamentally improve our tools to create web sites and apps.

It's much in the style of current web standards, using plain text files linked together to create the final site, but with a complete separation of content and presentation, where the content is pure semantic data written in XML, and the presentation and behavior layer is written in HSS, a new language based on CSS, but with many powerful features, such as hierarchical notation, object orientation, modularization for code reuse, expressions (math), vector graphics, references (bindings between objects), and a very long etc.

Framework
=========
HSS Framework to be included with the rendering engine. It will not be mandatory to use, but it will provide a starting point and a very useful tool box for web designers and developers.

Where to file bug reports
=========================
Please create a new issue here: https://github.com/AXR/Framework/issues/new. To make the process of fixing bugs easier, developers need to know what causes the problem and also on what platform it happens. Be as detailed as possible, and make sure to include the following points in your bug report:

    - What is happening.
    - What did you expect to happen.
    - How to reproduce.
    - Which version of the prototype is affected.
